# Testing Principles

## Test Structure

Follow AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) structure.

## Naming Conventions

| Language | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| TypeScript | `should [expected] when [condition]` | `it('should display error when input is invalid')` |
| Python | `test_action_condition_expected` | `def test_login_invalid_password_returns_401()` |
| C# | `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior` | `Login_InvalidPassword_ReturnsUnauthorized()` |

## Test Organization

- Group tests by class/module
- Sub-group by method or behavior
- Use descriptive describe/context blocks

## Mocking Best Practices

- Mock only external dependencies
- Don't mock internal implementation details
- Use factories for test data
- Verify interactions when behavior matters

## Test Isolation

- Each test must be independent
- No shared mutable state
- Tests should run in any order
- Clean up after each test

## What to Test

| Priority | What | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| High | Business logic | Core value |
| High | Edge cases | Common bugs |
| Medium | Error paths | Graceful degradation |
| Medium | Integration points | Contract verification |
| Low | Trivial getters/setters | Low value |

## Coverage Guidelines

- **80%+** on business logic
- **100%** on critical paths (payments, auth)
- Don't chase coverage numbers blindly
- One meaningful test > many trivial tests

## Anti-Patterns

- DO NOT write tests that depend on execution order — each test must be independently runnable
- DO NOT test implementation details — test behavior and outcomes
- DO NOT over-mock — excessive mocking tests mocks, not code
- DO NOT accept flaky tests — use deterministic data and mock time
- DO NOT put slow tests in the unit suite — tag them and run separately
